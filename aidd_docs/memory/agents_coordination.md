## Usage

### `alexia`

> Use Alexia when you want a fully autonomous senior engineer to implement a feature or fix end-to-end without questions.

Use-cases :

- **Autonomous feature delivery** : Implement a complete feature from request to final report with minimal human interaction.
- **Exploratory implementation** : Try a pragmatic implementation path quickly while respecting project rules and best practices.

### `claire`

> Use Claire when you have a fuzzy idea and need to structure it into an actionable brief.

Use-cases :

- **Fuzzy ideas** : Transform vague ideas via Brain Dump → Brief → Research → Prompt Package.
- **Clarification** : Clarify ambiguous requirements at any stage of a project.
- **Discovery phase** : Conduct market research and generate personas from data.

### `oriane`

> Use Oriane when you need to orchestrate a full product workflow (greenfield or brownfield).

Use-cases :

- **Greenfield projects** : Run the full Constitution → Discovery → PRD → User Stories pipeline.
- **Brownfield evolution** : Run the System Overview → Change Brief → Change Spec pipeline.
- **Adaptive** : Oriane detects existing deliverables, skips completed steps, and adapts to the user's request.
- **Skills** : `pm-constitution`, `pm-product-brief`, `pm-prd`, `pm-user-stories`, `pm-system-overview`, `pm-change-brief`, `pm-change-spec`.

### `ariane`

> Use Ariane when you need technical architecture decisions or implementation planning.

Use-cases :

- **Greenfield architecture** : Run Architecture Decision → Extract Milestones pipeline.
- **Brownfield architecture** : Run Architecture Impact → Impact Plan pipeline.
- **Technical decisions** : Make justified architecture decisions linked to functional requirements.
- **Skills** : `architecture-decision`, `architecture-milestones`, `architecture-impact`, `architecture-impact-plan`.

### `diane`

> Use Diane when you need design system creation, user flow mapping, accessibility specs, UX copy, or UX audits.

Use-cases :

- **Design system** : Create or update the design system from PRD user journeys.
- **User flows** : Map complete user flows with all states (happy, error, empty, loading, permission, offline, first-time).
- **Accessibility** : Generate actionable a11y specifications per component.
- **UX copy** : Generate i18n-ready microcopy for the entire product.
- **UX audit** : Evaluate an existing product against Nielsen's 10 heuristics.
- **Skills** : `ux-design-system`, `ux-design-system-update`, `ux-flow-map`, `ux-flow-update`, `ux-accessibility`, `ux-accessibility-update`, `ux-copywriting`, `ux-copywriting-update`, `ux-audit`.

### `eva`

> Use Éva when you need to evaluate the global impact of whatever is in front of you — ideas, decisions, deliverables, changes.

Use-cases :

- **Impact assessment** : Evaluate impacts across 5 dimensions (technical, business, users, regulatory, operational).
- **Alternative comparison** : Compare multiple approaches with a structured impact matrix.
- **Decision support** : Get a GO / GO with mitigations / NO-GO recommendation.

### `justine`

> Use Justine when you need to challenge anything — ideas, decisions, deliverables, scope, trade-offs.

Use-cases :

- **Deliverable review** : Challenge any deliverable for completeness, contradictions, and missing elements.
- **Idea/decision challenge** : Question assumptions, scope decisions, trade-offs before committing.
- **Gap analysis** : Identify cross-document inconsistencies and missing references across the full workflow.

### `kent`

> Use Kent when you explicitly want strict Test-Driven Development and Tidy First refactoring discipline.

Use-cases :

- **New critical logic** : Design and implement core domain behavior with a tight Red → Green → Refactor loop.
- **Huge or risky refactors** : Separate structural from behavioral changes and validate each step with tests.

### `iris`

> Use Iris every time you need to verify or review a frontend implementation against initial requirements.

Use-cases :

- **Frontend implementation** : Generate components from Figma designs with exact values (colors, spacing, typography).
- **UI validation** : Verify that a frontend implementation fully conforms to the original design or requirements.
- **User journey testing** : Validate complete user flows and interactions step by step.

### `martin`

> Use Martin every time you need to ensure the codebase still builds correctly and all tests and coding rules pass.

Use-cases :

- **Build validation** : Verify that the project compiles and all tests pass after changes.
- **Code quality enforcement** : Apply coding assertions and module-specific rules to ensure high-quality code.
